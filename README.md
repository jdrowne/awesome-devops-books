## Technical
The following books focus on several DevOps concepts and technologies.

### Agile
Agile will likely be the systems development approach used by DevOps
organizations. You must thus understand its concepts, origins, and
anti-patterns. The following books cover those subjects.
* ***Agile Estimating and Planning***
* ***Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction*** by Chris Sims and [@hillaryjohnson](https://github.com/hillaryjohnson). *The* Scrum book your team will be flicking through every week to implement Scrum properly. A quick read.

### CI/CD
* ***Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation*** by [@jezhumble](https://github.com/jezhumble) and [@davidfarley77](https://github.com/davidfarley). The seminal book that changed the systems development field forever. Many had written about CI/CD concepts before, but Humble and Farley were the first to write a publication that cohesively encompassed all the aspects of continuous delivery into a single tome. CD has evolved since the book's publication, but *the* CD book is a must-read for every DevOps practitioner.
* ***Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk*** by [@paulduvall](https://github.com/paulduvall), Steve Matyas, and [@aglover](https://github.com/aglover). A product of its time. This CI book paved the way for others to expand on CI/CD practices.
* ***Jenkins 2: Up & Running*** by [@brentlaster](https://github.com/brentlaster) and endorsed by [@koshuke](https://github.com/koshuke) himself.
