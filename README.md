## Technical
As a DevOps practitioner you must master several technical concepts and
technologies.

Agile will likely be the systems development approach used by DevOps
organizations. You must thus understand its concepts, origin, anti-patterns.
The following books cover those subjects.

The seminal book that changed the systems development field forever. Many had written about CI/CD concepts before, but Humble and Farley were the first to write a publication that encompassed all the aspects of continuous delivery cohesively into a single tome.
